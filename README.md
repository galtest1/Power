# Powerlink - Laggy Form
## Instructions

- This registration form feels laggy and sluggish, try to fix this horrible user experience
- Implement form validation, which checks if each individual field is filled out, and causes the submit button to not do anything as long as there's at least one field that's not valid.
- The form logic could possibly be used somewhere else in the app, try to make it reusable
- Add an auto-complete functionality to the `City` input, which supports `["Tel Aviv", "Tiberias", "Haifa", "Hamburg", "Netanya", "New York"]`
